function: parse_php
docstring:This function parses a PHP file and returns the code as a string.
purpose: In software development, parsing refers to the process of analyzing a piece of code to understand its structure and meaning. This functionality can be used to extract information from PHP files, such as variable names or function definitions, for further processing or analysis. It is commonly used in IDEs, linters, and other tools that work with PHP code.<?php

function: namespace
docstring: This function is used to define a specific namespace for a group of related classes, interfaces, functions, or constants. It helps to organize and group similar code together, making it easier to maintain and understand.
purpose: In software development, namespaces are used to prevent naming conflicts and to improve code organization. This functionality allows developers to create modular and reusable code, making it easier to collaborate and scale projects.namespace App\Http\Middleware;

function: TrustHosts
docstring: This middleware class is responsible for determining which hosts should be trusted by the application. It checks if the request is coming from a trusted host and only allows access if it is deemed safe.
purpose: In software development, it is important to protect the application from malicious attacks. This functionality ensures that only requests from trusted hosts are allowed, preventing unauthorized access and keeping the application secure. It is particularly useful in web applications where sensitive information may be transmitted. By defining a list of trusted hosts, this middleware provides an extra layer of security for the application.use Illuminate\Http\Middleware\TrustHosts as Middleware;

function: hosts
docstring: Returns an array of host patterns that are trusted by the middleware.
purpose: This functionality allows developers to specify which hosts should be trusted by the middleware, ensuring secure and reliable communication between the application and external sources. It helps prevent unauthorized access and malicious attacks on the software. class TrustHosts extends Middleware
{
    /**
     * Get the host patterns that should be trusted.
     *
     * @return array<int, string|null>
     */
    public function hosts()
    {
        return [
            $this->allSubdomainsOfApplicationUrl(),
        ];
    }
}
