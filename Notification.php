function: MustVerifyEmail
docstring: This interface defines the contract for a user model to indicate that the user must verify their email address.
purpose: This functionality is used in software development to ensure that a user's email address is valid and can be used for communication and account verification purposes. By implementing this interface, developers can easily add email verification functionality to their user model, providing an extra layer of security and ensuring that only legitimate users have access to the application. It also helps to prevent spam and fake accounts, making the application more reliable and trustworthy for users. use Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\MustVerifyEmail;
 function: HasFactory
  docstring: This trait provides a factory method for creating model instances with default attributes.
  purpose: In software development, factories are used to quickly and easily generate test data for testing or seeding a database. The HasFactory trait specifically allows for the creation of model instances using default values, making it a convenient tool for developers to use for generating data during testing or initial setup of their application. This functionality can save developers time and effort in manually creating and populating model instances, allowing them to focus on other aspects of their application.use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories\HasFactory;

function: User
docstring: This class represents a user in the system and extends the Authenticatable base class. It contains methods for accessing user information and managing user authentication.
purpose: The User class is a fundamental component of user management in software development. It encapsulates the necessary functionality for user authentication and provides a convenient interface for accessing and managing user data. This class allows developers to easily incorporate user functionality into their software, making it an essential component in building secure and user-friendly applications.use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;

function: useNotifiable
docstring: This function imports the Notifiable trait from the Illuminate\Notifications package, allowing the model to send notifications.
purpose: The useNotifiable function enables the model to utilize the features of the Notifiable trait, which includes sending notifications to users. This is particularly useful in software development as it allows for easier implementation of notification functionality without having to write complex code from scratch. This saves time and effort for developers and ensures consistent and efficient notification handling across the application. use Illuminate\Notifications\Notifiable;

function: HasApiTokens
docstring: This function adds the ability for a user model to have API tokens for authentication and authorization purposes.
purpose: In software development, API tokens are used to grant access to specific resources or data to a user. This function allows a user model to have API tokens associated with it, making it easier to implement API authentication and authorization in a Laravel application. This can improve security and streamline the process of granting API access to users. use Laravel\Sanctum\HasApiTokens;

function: Sortable
docstring: This function allows for columns in a table to be sortable by clicking on the column header. It uses the Sortable library and adds sorting functionality to the table.
purpose: In software development, sorting data is a common and essential task. This function simplifies the process of implementing sortable columns in a table, saving time and effort for developers. It also improves the user experience by allowing them to easily organize and manipulate data in a table.use Kyslik\ColumnSortable\Sortable;

Function Name: Notification

Docstring: This function creates a notification for a specific user, which can be used to inform the user about important events or updates.
