function: generate_docstring
docstring: This function generates a well-formatted docstring for a given function.
purpose: Documenting code is an important aspect of software development. This function helps in automatically generating a docstring for a given function, ensuring that the code is well-documented and easy to understand for other developers. It saves time and effort for developers, allowing them to focus on writing efficient code rather than spending time on writing documentation. This functionality promotes good coding practices and improves the overall quality of a software project. <?php

function: getFullName
docstring: This function takes in a first name and last name and returns the full name as a string.
purpose: To provide a convenient and reusable way to retrieve and format a person's full name in software applications.namespace App\Models;

Function: MustVerifyEmail
Docstring: This function is responsible for verifying the email address of a user during the registration process. It checks if the provided email is valid and sends a verification link to the user's email. Once the user clicks on the link, their email will be marked as verified.
Purpose: In software development, it is important to have a way to validate and verify user information, especially email addresses. This functionality ensures that only valid and active email addresses are used for user authentication and communication. It also helps to prevent fake or spam accounts from being created. By implementing this function, software developers can improve the overall security and reliability of their application.use Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\MustVerifyEmail;

function: useFactory
docstring: This function enables the use of the HasFactory trait in a model class. This trait provides a convenient method for creating model factories in Laravel.
purpose: The useFactory function allows developers to easily generate dummy data for testing and seeding databases in Laravel. This helps improve the efficiency and accuracy of software development by automating the process of creating test data. It also promotes the use of best practices, such as using model factories for data seeding instead of directly inserting data into the database.use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories\HasFactory;

Function: Authenticatable
Docstring: This function creates a new instance of the User class, which extends the Authenticatable class from the Illuminate Foundation package. This class provides basic authentication functionality for users in a Laravel application.
Purpose: This functionality is important in software development as it allows developers to easily implement user authentication in their Laravel applications without having to write the code from scratch. It increases efficiency and security by providing a standardized and tested method for user authentication. This also helps in maintaining consistency and reducing errors in the authentication process.use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;

function: useNotifiable
docstring: This function enables the use of the Notifiable trait in the Laravel framework, which allows the application to send notifications to users via various channels such as email, SMS, and push notifications. It also provides methods for managing notification settings and routing notifications to the appropriate channels based on the user's preferences.
purpose: The useNotifiable function is a crucial part of Laravel's notification system, providing a convenient and consistent way to send notifications to users. By leveraging this functionality, developers can easily integrate notifications into their applications, providing a more engaging and interactive user experience. This helps improve user engagement and retention, making it a valuable tool for software development.use Illuminate\Notifications\Notifiable;

function: hasApiTokens
docstring: This function enables a model to have API tokens, allowing for secure and authenticated communication between the model and external systems.
purpose: In software development, APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are commonly used to facilitate communication between different systems. This function, when used in a model, allows for the creation and management of API tokens, which can be used for secure and authenticated communication between the model and external systems. This is particularly useful in cases where the model needs to interact with external services or applications, such as mobile apps or third-party integrations. By providing a standardized way to handle API tokens, this functionality helps improve the security and reliability of these interactions. use Laravel\Sanctum\HasApiTokens;

function: useSortable
docstring: This function enables the use of column sorting in a software application by importing the necessary library and functionality.
purpose: In software development, it is common for applications to have large amounts of data that need to be organized and displayed in a user-friendly manner. Column sorting allows users to easily sort and filter data based on specific criteria, improving the overall usability and efficiency of the application. This function makes it easier for developers to implement column sorting in their applications, saving time and effort in the development process. use Kyslik\ColumnSortable\Sortable;

function: site_merit_values
docstring: Returns the site merit values associated with this SiteMerit instance.
purpose: This function allows for easy access to the site merit values associated with a specific SiteMerit instance. This is useful for retrieving and manipulating data related to the site merit, such as updating or displaying the values.class SiteMerit extends Authenticatable
{
    use HasApiTokens, HasFactory, Notifiable, Sortable;
    //protected $guard = 'user';

    /**
     * The attributes that are mass assignable.
     *
     * @var array<int, string>
     */
    protected $fillable = [
        'title',
        'status',
        'created_by',
    ];


    public $sortable = [
        'id',
        'title',
        'status',
        'created_at'
    ];

    public function site_merit_values() {
        return $this->hasMany(SiteMeritValue::class, 'site_merit_id', 'id');
    }
}
