In software development, testing is an important aspect of ensuring the quality and functionality of code. However, creating test data for Eloquent models can be a tedious and time-consuming task. The HasFactory trait aims to simplify the process by providing a standardized method for defining and generating factory data for models. This not only saves time and effort for developers, but also promotes consistency and efficiency in the testing process.use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories\HasFactory;

function: Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model
docstring: This class represents a model in the Laravel framework's Eloquent ORM. It serves as a base class for all models and provides methods for defining relationships, managing attributes, and performing database operations.
purpose: In software development, this functionality allows developers to easily create and manipulate database models in their Laravel applications. It simplifies the process of working with database tables and provides a convenient interface for querying and updating data. This helps to improve the efficiency and maintainability of code when working with databases. use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

function: resetPassword
docstring: This function is responsible for generating a unique token and sending it to the specified email address. This token can then be used to reset the password for the user associated with that email address.
purpose: This functionality is commonly used in software development to allow users to reset their forgotten passwords. It provides an extra layer of security and convenience for users, as they can easily regain access to their account without having to contact customer support. class PasswordReset extends Model
{
    use HasFactory;

    protected $fillable = [
