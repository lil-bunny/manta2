function: php_tag
docstring: This function generates a standard PHP opening tag, <?php.
purpose: The purpose of this functionality is to provide a quick and easy way to insert the standard PHP opening tag in a code file, saving time and ensuring consistency in code formatting. This is particularly useful in software development as it helps to maintain a clean and organized code structure.<?php

function: NullHandler
docstring: The NullHandler class is used to create a logging handler that discards all log messages. It can be used to suppress any log messages that are not needed in the application.
purpose: In software development, logging is an important tool for tracking and troubleshooting errors. However, in some cases, it may be necessary to disable logging for certain parts of the code or to prevent certain log messages from being recorded. The NullHandler provides a simple and efficient way to achieve this by creating a handler that essentially ignores all log messages. This can be useful in situations where certain log messages are not relevant or necessary, such as in production environments where performance is critical. Overall, the NullHandler helps to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of logging in software development. use Monolog\Handler\NullHandler;
 function:StreamHandler
  docstring:
  The StreamHandler class is used to handle logging records by writing them to a given stream, such as a file or console output. It is a subclass of the Handler class and implements the HandlerInterface interface. This class provides a basic functionality for logging, allowing developers to easily configure and customize the output of log records.
  purpose: This functionality is important in software development as it allows for logging and monitoring of application events and errors. By using the StreamHandler, developers can easily write log records to various streams and have control over the formatting and storage of these records. This helps in debugging and troubleshooting of applications, as well as providing valuable information for performance analysis and improvement. use Monolog\Handler\StreamHandler;

function: SyslogUdpHandler
docstring: This handler allows sending log messages to a remote syslog server using UDP protocol.
purpose: In software development, logging is an essential tool for recording and debugging application events. The SyslogUdpHandler provides a convenient way to send log messages to a remote syslog server, allowing developers to centralize and monitor application logs. This can help in troubleshooting issues, monitoring system performance, and detecting potential security threats. The use of UDP protocol also ensures efficient and fast delivery of log messages, making it suitable for real-time applications. use Monolog\Handler\SyslogUdpHandler;

function: configureLogging
docstring: Configures the logging options for the application
purpose: This function allows developers to easily specify the default log channel, deprecations log channel, and other log channels for their application. This is important for software development as proper logging helps with debugging, monitoring, and identifying potential issues in an application. This function also allows for customization of log handlers, levels, and formatting, providing flexibility for developers to suit their specific needs.return [
