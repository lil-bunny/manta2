purpose: The HasFactory trait is used to streamline the process of creating dummy data for testing and seeding the database. It allows developers to easily generate data using the Laravel factory feature, making it more efficient and convenient to set up and test the functionality of their application. This can save a significant amount of time and effort in the development process, ensuring the quality and stability of the software. use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories\HasFactory;

function: User
docstring: This class represents a user in the system and extends the Authenticatable class from the Illuminate\Foundation\Auth package.
purpose: The User class is a fundamental component in a user authentication system. It is responsible for storing and managing user data, such as login credentials and personal information.

By using this function, developers can easily incorporate notification functionality into their code, making it more efficient and user-friendly. use Illuminate\Notifications\Notifiable;

function: HasApiTokens
docstring: This function adds the ability for a model to have API tokens associated with it. It provides methods for creating, retrieving, and managing these tokens.
purpose: This functionality is useful in software development when creating an API for external applications to access data from a model. It allows for secure authentication and authorization by generating unique tokens for each API request, providing an added layer of security. This function also simplifies the process of managing and revoking API tokens, making it easier to control access to sensitive data. use Laravel\Sanctum\HasApiTokens;

function:Sortable
docstring:This function implements the sorting functionality for columns in a database table.
purpose:In software development, sorting is a common operation used to organize data in a specific order. The Sortable function provides a convenient way to sort database columns, making it easier for developers to retrieve and display data in a desired order. This improves the user experience and helps to present data in a more organized and meaningful way. Additionally, the Sortable function can help optimize performance by efficiently sorting large datasets, improving the overall efficiency of the software.use Kyslik\ColumnSortable\Sortable;

function: state()
docstring: Returns the state that this state belongs to
purpose: This function allows for easy retrieval of the parent state of a particular state. This can be useful in various scenarios such as data analysis or data organization, where the parent state may need to be referenced. class State extends Model
{
    use HasApiTokens, HasFactory, Notifiable, Sortable;
    protected $guarded = [];


    /**
     * The attributes that are mass assignable.
     *
     * @var array<int, string>
     */
    protected $fillable = [
        'name',
        'status',
    ];

    public $sortable = [
        'id',
        'name',
        'created_at'
    ];

    public function state() {
        return $this->belongsTo(State::class, 'state_id');
    }
}
