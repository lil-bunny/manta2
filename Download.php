function: User
docstring: This class defines the structure of a user in the application. It includes attributes such as name, email, and password, and provides methods for authentication and access control.
purpose: User is a fundamental component in software development as it allows for personalized and secure access to the application. This class provides a standardized way of creating and managing user accounts, making it easier to implement user-related features and ensure data privacy.namespace App\Models;

function: MustVerifyEmail
docstring: This interface defines the contract that a user model must implement in order to verify the email address associated with their account.
purpose: In software development, it is crucial to verify the email address of a user before allowing them access to certain features or sensitive information. This functionality provides a standard contract for implementing email verification in user models, ensuring that the verification process is consistent and secure across different systems. This not only enhances the security of the application but also provides a better user experience by preventing unauthorized access and ensuring that all users have a verified and valid email address associated with their account.use Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\MustVerifyEmail;

function: HasFactory
docstring: This function adds the HasFactory trait to a model, allowing it to use the factory method for creating instances of the model.
purpose: The HasFactory functionality is used in software development to easily generate fake data for testing and seeding purposes. By adding the HasFactory trait to a model, developers can quickly and efficiently create instances of the model with predefined attributes, making it easier to test and populate databases. This functionality also helps improve the overall quality and accuracy of the software being developed. use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories\HasFactory;

function: Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User
docstring: This function creates a user model that can be authenticated using Laravel's built-in authentication system. It contains all the necessary attributes and methods for user authentication, such as password hashing and verification, token generation, and user role management.
purpose: This functionality is crucial in web development as it allows for secure user authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authorized users can access certain parts of the system. It also simplifies the process of creating and managing user accounts, saving time and effort for developers. use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;

function: useNotifiable
docstring: This function adds the Notifiable trait to the model, allowing it to send notifications to users.
purpose: The useNotifiable function is a built-in Laravel functionality that allows developers to easily add the Notifiable trait to their model classes. This trait provides the ability for the model to send notifications to users, such as for email verification, password resets, or any other custom notifications. This functionality is useful for software development as it simplifies the process of implementing notifications in an application and allows for seamless communication with users.use Illuminate\Notifications\Notifiable;

function: useLaravel
docstring: This function allows the implementation of Laravel's Sanctum package, specifically the HasApiTokens trait which enables the usage of API tokens for authentication in API requests.
purpose: This functionality is useful in software development as it provides a secure and convenient way to authenticate API requests, especially for web applications that use Laravel as the backend framework. The use of API tokens adds an extra layer of security and allows for easier management of authentication for different users and applications. This helps to improve the overall user experience and security of the software.use Laravel\Sanctum\HasApiTokens;

Function: Sortable
Docstring: This function enables the sorting of data in a specified column in a table. It utilizes the Kyslik/ColumnSortable package to provide sorting functionality.
Purpose: Sorting data is a common and essential task in software development. This function allows for easy and efficient sorting of data, making it a valuable tool for organizing and analyzing large amounts of data. It also helps improve the user experience by allowing for quick and intuitive navigation through sorted data.use Kyslik\ColumnSortable\Sortable;

function: getUserById
docstring: This function retrieves a user object from the database based on the given user ID.
purpose: This functionality is used to fetch specific user information from the database, which can then be used for various purposes in software development, such as user authentication, profile management, or data analysis. It allows for efficient retrieval of user data without the need for manual database queries, saving time and effort for developers.use App\Models\User;

function: user
docstring: Returns the user associated with this download object.
purpose: This function allows for easy retrieval of the user object associated with a specific download, providing necessary information for tracking and auditing purposes in software development.class Download extends Authenticatable
