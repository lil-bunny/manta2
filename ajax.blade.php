Function: yield
Docstring: This function is used to pause the execution of a generator function and yield the value to the caller. It allows the generator function to resume from where it left off the next time it is called.
Purpose: The yield function is commonly used in Python for creating generators, which are functions that can be used to iterate over a sequence of values without storing them in memory. This functionality is useful for conserving memory and improving efficiency in cases where a large number of values need to be generated. It is also commonly used in asynchronous programming to create coroutines, which can be used for concurrent execution of multiple tasks. @yield('content')
