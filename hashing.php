function: parse_php
docstring: This function takes in a PHP file and returns a string representation of its contents.
purpose: This functionality is useful for software development as it allows for easier and more efficient manipulation of PHP code. It can be used for tasks such as parsing and analyzing code, automated code formatting, and code generation. By converting the PHP file into a string, developers can more easily access and manipulate the code, making the development process smoother and faster. <?php
 Function: Hash Driver Config
  Docstring: This function sets the default hash driver and allows for modification of the options for different hashing algorithms. It also specifies the configuration options for the Bcrypt and Argon algorithms.
  Purpose: This functionality is important in software development as it allows for secure password hashing, which is crucial for protecting sensitive user information. It also provides flexibility for developers to choose the best hashing algorithm and configure its options according to their needs. return [
