 function: php_start_tag
docstring: This function is used to insert the starting tag of PHP code in a document.
purpose: In software development, this functionality is important for marking the beginning of PHP code in a file. It is necessary for the server to recognize and interpret the code as PHP, allowing for the execution of PHP scripts. This function provides a convenient and standardized way to insert the starting tag, ensuring proper functioning of PHP code in a document. <?php

function: User
docstring: This class represents a user in the application. It contains information such as username, email, password, and profile picture.
purpose: This functionality allows for the creation and management of user accounts in the software, allowing users to access and personalize their experience within the application.namespace App\Models;

function: Model
docstring: This function represents a model in the Laravel framework's database layer. It is a class that extends the Eloquent Model, providing an intuitive and convenient way to interact with database tables. Using this function, developers can easily query, insert, update, and delete records from the database without writing raw SQL queries.
purpose: In software development, a model is a crucial component of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. It acts as an intermediary between the application's data and the business logic, providing a structured and organized way to handle database operations. The Model function in Laravel serves this purpose by abstracting away the complexities of database operations and providing a simple and intuitive interface for developers to work with. This results in faster and more efficient development, as well as easier maintenance and scalability of the application. use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

function: useFactory
docstring: This function allows the use of Eloquent factories in the database. It provides a convenient way to generate model instances with default attributes for testing or seeding purposes.
purpose: In software development, testing and seeding are crucial for ensuring the functionality and stability of a codebase. The useFactory function simplifies the process of creating model instances with predefined attributes, making it easier to perform these tasks and ultimately improve the overall quality and reliability of the software. use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories\HasFactory;

function: User
docstring: This class represents a user in the system and extends the Authenticatable class provided by the Laravel framework. It contains all the necessary attributes and methods for user authentication and authorization.
purpose: The User class is a crucial component of the authentication system in software development. It provides a standardized way of managing user data and permissions, making it easier for developers to implement secure user authentication and access control in their applications. By extending the Authenticatable class, it also inherits various useful methods for managing user sessions and passwords, reducing the overall development time and effort. use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;

Function: Notifiable
Docstring: This class provides the ability to send notifications to the user via different channels such as email, SMS, and database notifications.
Purpose: This functionality allows for easy integration of notifications into software development, providing a streamlined way to keep users informed and engaged with the application. It also reduces the need for developers to write custom code for each notification method, saving time and effort.use Illuminate\Notifications\Notifiable;

function: HasApiTokens
docstring: This trait allows a model to generate and manage API tokens for authentication purposes.
purpose: In software development, APIs are commonly used to allow communication between different systems or applications. This trait provides a convenient way for a model to generate and manage API tokens, allowing for secure authentication and authorization for API requests. This helps to ensure the integrity and security of the underlying system, making it more robust and reliable. use Laravel\Sanctum\HasApiTokens;

function: Sortable
docstring: This function allows for easy sorting of data within a column in a table. It takes in a column name and a direction (ascending or descending) as parameters and returns the sorted data in the specified order. It uses the Kyslik library to implement the sorting algorithm.
purpose: Sorting data is a common task in software development, especially when dealing with large amounts of data. This function provides a simple and efficient way to sort data within a specific column, making it easier for developers to organize and analyze their data. This can improve the overall performance and functionality of a software application.use Kyslik\ColumnSortable\Sortable;

function: menus
docstring: Returns a relationship between Role and Menu models, through the pivot table role_menu.
purpose: To define a many-to-many relationship between Role and Menu models, allowing for easy retrieval of menus associated with a specific role in the software development process.class Role extends Model
{
    use HasApiTokens, HasFactory, Notifiable, Sortable;
