function: php_open_tag
docstring: This function opens a PHP code block.
purpose: In software development, PHP code blocks are used to enclose PHP code that is to be executed on the server side. The php_open_tag function allows developers to easily open a PHP code block, making it simpler to write and organize PHP code within a larger program. This function is an essential part of building dynamic and interactive web applications with PHP.<?php

function: namespace
docstring: This function is used to define a namespace in the HTTP middleware. Namespaces are used to group and organize similar classes and functions together.
purpose: In software development, namespaces help in avoiding naming conflicts and make the code more organized and maintainable. This functionality allows developers to easily identify and access classes and functions within a specific namespace. namespace App\Http\Middleware;

function: VerifyCsrfToken
docstring: This middleware verifies the validity of the Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) token in HTTP requests. It checks if the token in the request matches the token generated for the user session and if it does not, the request is rejected for security purposes.
purpose: This functionality is important in software development to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive user data and actions. It helps protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks by ensuring that the request is coming from an authenticated source. This helps maintain the integrity of the application and protects user's privacy and security. use Illuminate\Foundation\Http\Middleware\VerifyCsrfToken as Middleware;

function: VerifyCsrfToken
docstring: This middleware ensures that all incoming requests have a valid CSRF token attached to it. It checks the token against the one stored in the session to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks. If the token is not present or does not match, the request is rejected.
purpose: This functionality is crucial for maintaining the security of web applications. It helps prevent unauthorized actions from being performed on behalf of a user by verifying the origin of requests. This is important in software development to protect sensitive user data and ensure the integrity of the application. class VerifyCsrfToken extends Middleware
{
    /**
     * The URIs that should be excluded from CSRF verification.
     *
     * @var array<int, string>
