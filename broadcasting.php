function: copy_file
 docstring: Copies a file to a specified destination.
 purpose: The copy_file function is used to copy a file from one location to another. This functionality is commonly used in software development when a user needs to duplicate a file or move a file to a different location. It can also be used for backup purposes or to create a duplicate of a file before making changes to the original. The docstring provides an understandable description of what the function does, making it easier for other developers to understand and use in their code.<?php
function:broadcast
docstring: This function allows the framework to broadcast events to other systems or over websockets using different connections such as Pusher, Ably, Redis, log, or null. It also allows the user to define a default broadcaster to be used by the framework when an event needs to be broadcast.
purpose: Broadcasting events is an essential feature in software development, especially for real-time applications. This functionality provides a convenient way for developers to broadcast events to different systems and connections, making it easier to implement real-time communication and updates in their applications. return [
