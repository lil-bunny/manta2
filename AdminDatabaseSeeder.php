purpose: The run function serves as a central control for executing all the database seeders in the Admin module. It allows for a seamless and organized way of seeding data into the database during development or testing. This helps in populating the database with necessary data that is required for the proper functioning of the software.namespace Modules\Admin\Database\Seeders;

function: seeder
docstring: Seeder class is used for populating the database with sample data. It is typically used in the development and testing stages of software development.

The Model function also helps in maintaining data integrity and security by providing built-in methods for data validation and authorization. use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

function: run
docstring: This function is responsible for running the database seeds to populate the database with initial data.
purpose: In software development, database seeding is a common practice to initialize the database with sample or default data. This function helps to automate this process by executing the necessary code to insert data into the database tables. It provides a convenient way to set up a development environment and test the functionality of the application without manually inserting data into the database. class AdminDatabaseSeeder extends Seeder
{
    /**
     * Run the database seeds.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function run()
    {
        Model::unguard();

        // $this->call("OthersTableSeeder");
