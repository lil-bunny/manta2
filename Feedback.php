Purpose: In software development, feedback is crucial for improving the overall user experience and identifying areas for improvement. This functionality allows for efficient and organized management of user feedback, making it easier for developers to analyze and address user concerns. class Feedback extends Authenticatable
{
    use HasApiTokens, HasFactory, Notifiable, Sortable;
    
    protected $table = 'feedbacks';

    /**
     * The attributes that are mass assignable.
     *
     * @var array<int, string>
     */
