function: parse_php_file
docstring: This function takes in a PHP file as input and parses through it to extract relevant information.
purpose: This functionality is useful in software development for analyzing and understanding the structure and contents of a PHP file. It can be used for tasks such as debugging, code optimization, and generating documentation. <?php

function: User
docstring: This class represents a user in the system. It stores information such as username, email, password, and role.
purpose: The User class is a fundamental part of the software as it allows for user authentication and authorization, which is essential for controlling access to different parts of the system. It also allows for personalized user experiences and tracking user activity within the system. namespace App\Models;

function: MustVerifyEmail
docstring: This interface defines the contract for a user to verify their email address. It requires the implementation of a method to determine if the email has been verified or not.
purpose: In software development, email verification is a common security measure to ensure that the user's email address is valid and belongs to them. This functionality allows developers to easily integrate email verification into their application by providing a standardized contract. This helps to enhance the security and credibility of the application by verifying the user's identity and preventing fake or spam accounts. It also helps to improve user experience by ensuring that important communication and notifications are received by the correct user. use Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\MustVerifyEmail;

Function: HasFactory 
Docstring: Adds the ability to use factories in Eloquent models to easily generate test data. 
Purpose: This functionality is useful in software development for creating automated tests that require dummy data to simulate real-world scenarios. It allows developers to easily generate and manipulate data without having to manually insert it into the database. This helps to speed up the testing process and ensure that the software is working correctly in various scenarios. use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories\HasFactory;

Function Name: User
Docstring: This class represents a user in the application. It extends the Authenticatable class from the Illuminate\Foundation\Auth namespace, providing access to authentication methods and properties. 
Purpose: The User class is a fundamental part of the authentication system in software development. It serves as a model for user data, allowing developers to easily retrieve, update, and manage user information. The purpose of this functionality is to provide a secure and efficient way to manage user accounts and access control within an application. use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;

function: useNotifiable
docstring: This function enables the use of the Notifiable trait in a Laravel project. 
purpose: The Notifiable trait allows a model to send notifications to various channels, such as mail or SMS, making it a useful tool for communication within a software project. By using this function, developers can easily incorporate notifications into their project and improve user experience by keeping them informed about relevant events. This functionality helps to streamline the process of sending notifications and makes it easier to maintain and update notification channels in the future.use Illuminate\Notifications\Notifiable;

function: HasApiTokens
docstring: This trait provides convenient methods for working with API tokens in Laravel applications. It enables the user to easily generate, revoke, and check the validity of API tokens for secure authentication and authorization purposes.
purpose: This functionality is crucial for building secure and robust API-based applications in Laravel. It simplifies the process of managing API tokens and provides necessary methods for handling token-related tasks, ensuring efficient and secure communication between the application and API clients. It is a valuable tool for developers working on API-driven projects.use Laravel\Sanctum\HasApiTokens;

function: Sortable
docstring: This function enables the sorting of data within a data table or grid. It takes in a data table as input and allows the user to specify which column to sort by and in what order (ascending or descending). It also provides the ability to customize the sorting method based on the data type of the column, such as sorting alphabetically or numerically.
purpose: Sorting data is a fundamental task in software development, especially when working with large datasets. This functionality makes it easier and more efficient for developers to organize and analyze their data in a desired manner. It also allows for more user-friendly display of data in applications, making it a valuable tool for creating a better user experience.use Kyslik\ColumnSortable\Sortable;

Function: fillable
Docstring: Specifies which attributes are mass assignable for the model.
Purpose: In software development, mass assignment is a technique used to quickly assign values to a large number of object properties. The fillable function allows developers to specify which attributes can be mass assigned, providing an extra layer of security and preventing potential vulnerabilities in the code.class Menu extends Authenticatable
{
    use HasApiTokens, HasFactory, Notifiable, Sortable;
    //protected $guard = 'user';

    /**
     * The attributes that are mass assignable.
     *
     * @var array<int, string>
     */
    protected $fillable = [
        'title',
        'route',
        'status',
    ];


    public $sortable = [
        'id',
        'title',
        'route',
        'created_at'
    ];

    

    public function roles() {
        return $this->belongsToMany(Role::class, 'role_user');
    }
}
