function: phpDocstringGenerator
docstring: This function generates a docstring in the required format for PHP functions.
purpose: Docstrings provide a way to document code and explain its purpose, inputs, and outputs. This functionality is essential in software development as it helps developers understand and use functions correctly, making their code more readable and maintainable. By generating docstrings automatically, this function saves time and ensures consistency in documentation across functions. <?php

function: configureFilesystem
docstring: This function is used to configure the filesystem disks for an application. It allows for the setting of a default disk and the configuration of multiple disks with different drivers. It also allows for the creation of symbolic links.
purpose: The purpose of this functionality is to provide a convenient and customizable way for developers to manage their application's filesystem and storage options. By configuring multiple disks, developers can easily switch between different storage solutions, such as local, cloud-based, or FTP. The ability to create symbolic links also enables the linking of storage locations to publicly accessible directories, making it easier to serve files to users. This functionality is essential for managing and organizing files within a software application.return [
