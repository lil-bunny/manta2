Function: password reset language lines
Docstring: This function generates language lines for the password reset feature, which is used when a user has forgotten their password and needs to reset it. The language lines provide messages for different scenarios, such as a successful password reset, a sent email with a password reset link, throttling to prevent multiple reset attempts, and errors related to an invalid token or user. These language lines are customizable and can be translated for different languages.
Purpose: The purpose of this functionality is to provide clear and concise messaging for the password reset process, which enhances the user experience and helps to troubleshoot any errors that may occur. This can also save time for developers by providing a standardized set of language lines to use in their code.return [
